[ ] task already started, default focus in workspace
if a worker logs into a station with multiple modules / panels, and one of them has a task already on going for him/her, it should auto focus that task

[ ] first name and last name only
If a worker logs in who has multiple first names and last names added display only one first name and one last name (e.g. Juan Carlos Urreta Lopez should be Juan Urreta)

[ ] Remove the "Change station"
Remove the "Change station" button feature altogether. if he wants to change station he has to log out

[ ] Station context
Station context should be stored per device. We want to be able to set station groups in the context (which should be saved)
These groups include: Panel line (when this is set, before even showing the login screen the user must choose from a list of only the panel stations). Choosing one logs the user into the specific station, but doesn't overwrite the station context saved preference, which stays as "Panel line" such that upon log out the next user is asked to choose specific station.
Similar groups exist for each of the assembly lines, where each of the assembly stations of the same sequence_order are shown and the user is asked to adjust which one he picks
