- Backend uses SQLAlchemy ORM models as the initial schema source, with a simple `Base.metadata.create_all` initializer and `DATABASE_URL` config until migrations are introduced.
- Added an `admin_sessions` table with hashed session tokens for HTTP-only cookie auth (server-side session storage).
- Backup tooling stores `.dump` files plus `backup_settings.json`/`backup_metadata.json` under `backend/backups`, with automation handled either by `app.scripts.backup_runner` or the in-app scheduler.
- Backup restore creates a manual checkpoint backup, restores the selected `.dump` into a new database, then swaps names so the primary database points at the restored data.
- Backup scheduling can run inside the FastAPI process via a startup background task that polls settings and triggers `pg_dump` when due.
- House parameter value editing treats empty module inputs as deletions and saves values scoped to the selected house type plus optional subtype (null subtype means default values).

- Module Rules UI treats expected duration resolution with the same most-specific-wins order as task applicability (module -> house type -> default) when showing baseline values.
